SAFS 405 - Sustainable Agriculture and Food Production ,Credits: 4,"Attributes: Environment,TechSociety(Disc)","This course introduces the fundamental concepts that define sustainable and organic agriculture. We will explore the scientific and biological principles that underlie sustainable and organic farming techniques and methods, and each student will explore research-based evidence surrounding the sustainability of different practices within the agricultural and food system. We will study the environmental, social and economic impacts of different food production systems, with an emphasis on systems common in the U.S. Finally, we will look at the role each of us has in influencing how food is grown, either as producer or as a consumer."

SAFS 410 - A Taste of the Tropics ,Credits: 4,Attributes: World Cultures(Discovery),"This course will expose students to the exciting world of tropical agriculture and the ways that people in the tropics utilize a diverse array of food crops. Our lives as consumers in the developed world are touched by tropical products every single day. Whether it's the cinnamon in your tea, the vanilla in your cookies, the black pepper on your salad, or your cup of hot coffee, you likely consume tropical crops whether you know it or not. Ever stop to wonder where these items are from and how they are produced? We will examine agriculture and food culture throughout the tropical world's four principle areas: Latin America, Tropical Asia, Tropical Africa, and the South Pacific. Production systems ranging from large scale modern high input operations to home subsistence gardens are explored. Tropical crops are examined in five major groups: grains and legumes, starchy roots, exotic vegetables, tropical fruit, and herbs, spices, medicinal plants. Cultural uses of these crops throughout the tropical world are given special emphasis."

SAFS 510 - Agriculture and Development in the Neotropics ,Credits: 4,Attributes: World Cultures(Discovery),"Course is designed as a three week immersion into tropical agriculture and Costa Rican ecology and culture. Agriculture plays a pivotal role in Costa Rica's history and in shaping current events. Production of horticultural and agronomic crops occurs on a variety of scales ranging from large export based systems, to mid-sized operations for domestic sales, and sustenance based home gardens. Examples of all systems are visited and discussions focus on their overall sustainability. Sustainability is a broad concept and requires consideration of socio-cultural, environmental, and economic factors. Agriculture and agricultural products infuse the culture as seen by large participation in farmers markets and appreciation for a wide variety of fruits and vegetables prepared in myriads of ways. An appreciation for nature also infuses the culture and is embodied by the country's extensive system of national parks and protected reserves along with the national philosophy of 'Pura Vida'.
